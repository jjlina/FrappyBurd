# FrappyBurd
To learn the basics of creating in Unity, I recreated a flappy bird clone using a tutorial. Credits go to: Game Maker's Toolkit on Youtube.

GMT provided assets like the bird and the pipe, to easily use instead, which was used in this project. His video provides very helpful
explaniations of how unity works, the uses of each code in the project, and visuals to describe how the code funtions.
